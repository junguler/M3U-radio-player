# M3U-radio-player
wrestle with artifical dumbness (chat gpt 4o) for a few hours to create a m3u radio player, this page is not fully featured yet, but here are the things that currently does:

* local and/or online playlist loading support
* automatic checking of stream links and skipping unresponsive ones after 1 second of them not playing
* very basic audio normalization feature, most music should play at the same level of loudness
* basic playlist window that shows currently playing stream and can be clicked to play that spicifc entry

things i want to add, eventually:

* a basic visualizer
* better styling for everything
* defualt set of streams that are loaded in automatically
* actual design of a proper audio player after the functionality is there
